What is DevOps?
	Ø DevOps is the process of building deploying and testing the code written on the same day we can achieve it by continuous integration , continuous deployment , continuous delivery and continuous testing
	
	Ø SDLC : software development life cycle.
		○ Requirement analysis.
		○ Planning.
		○ Design --> general requirements to technical requirements
		○ Implementation
		○ Deployment
		○ Testing
		○ Maintenance
	Ø SMS : school management system.
		○ Gurukuls(50 years ago): (water fall methodology)
			▪ Pass percentage is 30-40 % due to year end exams
		○ Stake holders:
			▪ Parents  :  serious (they only pay fee)
			▪ Students  :  Not serious(they will study in year end)
			▪ Teachers  :  Not serious (they have time to complete the syllabus)
		○ Model schools(20 years ago): (agile methodology)
			▪ Pass percentage is 80-90% because they introduced unit tests and quarterly and half yearly exams
		○ Stake holders:
			▪ Parents  :  serious (they only pay fee)
			▪ Students  :  Not serious(they will study before exams)
			▪ Teachers  :  serious (they have to complete the syllabus in time)
		○ Present schools: (Devops methodology)
			▪ Pass percentage is 95 - 99% because they introduced slip tests, daily tests, weekly tests
		○ Stake holders:
			▪ Parents  :  serious (they only pay fee)
			▪ Students  :  serious(they need to study every day)
			▪ Teachers  :  serious (they have to complete the syllabus in time)

	Ø Waterfall : 
		○ Once requirements are fixed we can't change them.
		○ Will take 2 years for project to go for production.
	Ø Agile :
		○ Final product is divided into multiple modules.
			▪ Ex : login and sign up
				Orders
				Menu….etc
		○ Will have certain deadlines to complete the module within that time both development and  testing need to complete(if 1 month is the time 15 days is for development and 15 days is for testing).
	Ø Devops :
		○ Whatever the code developers writes in the day will be deployed and tested on the same day
	Note : Environments - DEV,QA, SIT,UAT,PERF,PREPROD,PROD
