LINUX ADMINISTRATION:
	Ø User management
	Ø CRUD --> create read update delete
	Ø useradd <user  name> --> creates user
	Ø id <user-name> -->displays the user info
	Ø Group --> list of similar members
	Ø Create devops group, add team members to the group
	Ø In linux when you create user, by default group also will be created with the same name
	Ø There are 2 types of groups one is primary and other is secondary group
	Ø Every user should have 1 primary group and atleast 1 secondary group

	Ø groupadd <group name> --> will creates group
	Ø usermod -g <group name> --> wll adds the primary group to the user
	Ø usermod -aG <group name> --> will adds the secondary group to the user
	Ø Note : while deleting a user first we need to delete primary, secondary groups and home directory  
	Ø gpasswd -d <user> <group name> --> will delete the user from the group
	Ø Then after that move the user primary group using usermod -g<group name> to his home group (primary group should be there before deleting the user so that’s why we are adding user to his own group)
	Ø After that delete the user using userdel <username>


	Ø After getting credentials how user will login
	Ø After creating user first we need to set the password using passwd <username> 
	Ø But he cant login with key 
	Ø By default in linux we cant login with password
	Ø So we need to change the configurations
	Ø For that we need to go to vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	Ø So in that we need to change the password authentication from no to yes  
	Ø If we do any wrong changes in config there might be a  chance of deletion of all users credentials
	Ø So for that we need to run a rest using sshd -t
	Ø Then after that we need to restart the server using systemctl restart sshd
