	Ø What is computer--> all the IP enabled services are computers(laptop == mobile == server == chip == tv ==> computer)
	Ø Server --> host the applications
	Ø Difference b/w server and client
		○ Lawyer is a server and we are the clients
	Ø https://www.joindevops.com
		○ Protocol: https
		○ Port: 443
		○ IP: DNS IP
		○ Username and password --> authentication
	Ø Linux server :
		○ SSH --> Secure shell
		○ Port : 22
		○ IP, Username, password/private key
	Ø Firewall--> checks Inbound and outbound traffic
	Ø Authentication :
		○ What you know-->Password, Username
		○ What you have  -->Token, Authenticator , rsa token
		○ What you are     -->finger print, face ID, Retina
	Ø Server == box == node
		○ Lock == public(which is visible to every one)
		○ Key == private (which is with only one)
	Ø key pairs --> public key and private key
	Ø Flow of connecting a server
		1. create key pair
		2. create firewall
		3. import public key to aws account
		4. create server and attach public key
		5. attach firewall to server
	Ø Git Bash --> Mini Linux in windows
	SSH client
	Ø browser --> http/https client
	Ø Linux Server --> SSH Server
	
	Ø git bash == putty == super putty == mobaxterm == mac terminal = windows cmd
	Ø User Directory
		○ C:\Users\siva --> windows format
		○ /c/Users/siva --> linux format
	
	Ø windows --> not case sensitive Siva == siva == Siva
	Linux --> case sensitive --> Siva != siva no space in linux
		○ /c/devops/daws-84s == C:\devops\daws-84s
		○ ssh-keygen -f <file-name>
		
		○ ssh-keygen -f joindevops

	Ø For connecting the server to AWS account : 

	Ø After creating AWS account region should be US east -1
	Ø For creating firewall
		○ EC2--> security groups --> create security group -->changes as per requirement
	Ø For Creating Key pairs 
		○ EC2 --> Key pairs(if you don’t have create ) or else --> import key pair(already public key created in directory)
	Ø For launching the instances
		○ EC2 --> Instances --> launch instances --> add all the requirements
	Ø Then after that copy the Public key 
	Ø Using the command ssh -I <private key> ec2-user@public IP
		○ EX : ssh -i joindevops ec2-user@44.201.47.56
	Ø Finally server is connected
